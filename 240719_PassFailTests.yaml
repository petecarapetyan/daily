240719_PassFailTests.yaml:
  - fail if:
    - anything relies on me
    - aggression as spoiler is both easy and unrecognizable:
      - AKA no PID or elbow sequences or ...
    - does not:
      - have own PID or elbow sequences
      - self adjust PID or elbow sequences as iterative process
      - have fun way to model itself
      - place every major information source as a subset contributor to PID++:
        - my list of story stuff
        - every religion
        - every autocracy
        - every fable
        - every common sense story 
        - work in a visible, easy to understand way:
          - one simple elbow at a time
          - no mystery, just size - like DNA itself
  - still not obvious:
    - how to make the process visible, despite size (again, think DNA)
    - how to divide up the work 
    - how to even identify what music looks like:
      - the Caro problem 
      - the meaning of life problem 
      - the success shifting problem 
      - the dead cow and chicken but not dog problem 
    - how to address any of dozens of transitional problems:
      - traumatized humans
      - shame bonding
      - anger and dependencies relationship
      - emotions as intermediary and any other evolutionary 
    - what is ideal:
      - population density
      - etc
    - how to design in `cannot be hijacked`
    - vulnerability to one person and a program on one box can create a molecule to destroy all life on earth
    - how to make models size agnostic just less accurate at lower fidelity?
    - how to institutionalize all things logical into less concrete somethings:
      - example:
        - checks and balances:
          - concrete:
            - specific to very specific and structured concrete etc
          - abstract:
            - failing test is that easy to hijack 
    -
