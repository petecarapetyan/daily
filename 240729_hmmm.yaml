  - so much going on, hard to picture
  - in cc world have the ability to use this as a microcosm
  - in cc world the apparent coming crash is forcing me to re-evaluate
  - the common thread to everything is two ends:
    - wet chemistry at DNA on one end
    - picture maintenance on the other end
  - if the role of the human is to go beyond grubbing, to the picture:
    - what is the picture?
    - how to look at the picture when it is changing - but not known to what?
  - in cc world we are the ones that does what nobody else gets
  - the reason we get paid more is that nobody else gets it
  - but, do we really get it, ourselves?
  - why is the data being moved around so much?
  - is it just the specific ways we are currently moving data? Or any way?
  - how does wet chemistry & DNA relate to picture maintenance
  - how does story relate to the picture?
  - how to tell a story in a 4 generation sound bite world?
  - repicture:
    - cc:
      - from training how to move data in this narrow system
      - to training how to learn systems in order, to a wider question of what is next or missing?
    - betterology:
      - from taking a position in relatively static system that is still to fast for grubbers
      - to accepting how screwy this is, and picturing accordingly, mostly from scratch
    - grandparenting:
      - from acting in the role of doting support
      - to recapturing the essence of what it means to be human
    - home:
      - from maintaining equilibrium as citizen consumer
      - to carving out enough extra cycles to address some other roles
  - group repicturing:
    - what we did learn:
      - we learned how to split up tasks into "jobs"              
      - we learned how to increase productivity by measuring results
      - we learned how to drill down to primal level wet chemistry
      - we learned how to kill off people considered useless with drug addiction
      - we learned how to hijack wet chemistry with social media
      - how to maximize wealth for certain groups
      - how to move data around in the interest of enterprises
    - what we did not learn yet:
      - how to share a common picture between disparate groups
      - how to understand wet chemistry in the context of primary secondary tertiary and being hijacked
  - what i do and do not want to do:
    - do want to pitch the idea of migrating to whatever is next
    - do not want to do so by pushing fear and crazy and limited options:
      - it is true that our ability to understand options is less than our ability to create options
      - it is not true that the proper response is to simply subset known options
  - pete's functional definition of the meaning of life:
    - wet chemistry via DNA in an extremely fortunate set of circumstances for same
  - progression of change:
    - what do we have now?
    - what is the maximum 15% change that would be next ideal option?
