  - Trump is moving one inch back from extremes to claim back the middle with both unions and social issues:

    - amazing
  - this video does a sweet job of surfacing just how completely crazy the right wing support is, especially the Peter Thiel part haha:

  - once again, in this context, everything that I am doing is proving to be imperically flawed in the extreme:
    - I am attempting to aggregate facts:
      - and instead the aggregation of facts is being used against this very process 
    - Force and predation is just a different beast
    - This is something that is directional, and we are instead thinking in tactical terms
    - It is so obvious that you cannot talk about it 
    - Takes entirely different kind of focus 
    - And we still don't even begin to get it 
    - So my question to myself, is what is even the point?:
      - why bother if everything can and will be undone as fast as we can do it?
      - how to ack aggression when our entire system is built on non-aggression?
      - how to ack aggression when PA is itself so powerful?
      - this is like Peaky Blinders - brutal and asymetric
    - I like doing systems, and instead I am stuck here looking at aggression:
      - it is a field I am not interested in
      - it is not something that anyone seems competent in 
      - it is always subsetted beyond recognition 
      - subsetting is death, in the fight against aggression
