# daily

This is first attempt to join 2 boxes and still stay local yaml/markdown

## Proposed daily flow

- udu for daily automations
- daily for daily notes on btrg and other
- various such as 11tyThemes as required
- attempts to organize what does not want to stay organized using other tools

## Other tools called in to help

- yaml editor as central organizing tool
- can I go from yaml to markdown?
- somehow point AI to specific repositories as my base line context
- udu as a pivot tool for organizing other pivot tools
- 

## Approach to simplifying in pete-scatter-world

- focus on more singular list of objectives
- every thing that I do have summarization somewhere to bring any pursuit back into singular list of objectives as rabbit hole
- ackowledge impossibility of this and start from there
- 

## Flights of fancy

- i am just writing into files, like this here
- some things are topical, and want to become more structured later, like this here
- other things are just random cruft
- when i get to some concrete need such as right now when I wish that this was yaml instead of markdown :( here is where I wish that ... what do i wish for?
- the most common situation is I am in a context and I say to myself hey I am in this context and it is a deep area full of ancillary data that is not even recorded within the text, but it is still acting on my understanding of the context. But what I need from this moment is to be able to re-enter this context later especially with very specific elbow like sequences to go through for allowing me to negotiate a return to this context in a skillful and well informed manner
- good gawd this is so impossible due to all the things that are missing, and so frkn easy in the sense that there are so many things that yes, it is possible to improve, quite easily

## Critical Nature of Iterations

The most important part of my cc and btrg jobs, as well as the satisfaction of my personal life such as cooking, grandparenting, hygiene, housekeeping, guitar, jeff house shop, and financial admin, is the back and forth of

- context entry and exit without losing ratchet
- sequence of elbows
- iterations and WTF on running in competely experimental ways

All of the above requires atomic tooling at really fundamental levels. And it is always expected to either be a skill (too specific to grey matter to help much) or an app (too locked in to WTF - an app?)

Thus here are the crazies:
- everything about context re-acquisition is always a guess as to the momentary experience of the person that needs to acquire context in a WYSINATI world - FAIL
- PID or elbow sequences are rarely obvious or even similar between contexts - FAIL
- TMI everywhere you look or don't look
This is so fucked up. And probably a good opportunity.

## Apps suck

- by the time you get to an app you are already too constrained
- your data is locked up
- your schema is too specific
- your actions are too concrete
- you gotta know how to do everything

## Enterprise sucks

- same as apps suck above
- what a fucked up mess
- plus all the human layers
- 

## everything that sucks or is vulnerable to betterology

- tertiary
- long chain production when shorter works (replicator)
- moving peeps instead information
- hierarchical squatting
- aggression of all types
- masking/deceit/contrivances/push/fake
- size mob etc
- loudness
- anything that could be more atomic
- WYSINATI as reality
- addictions
- nose rings of all types
- dependent relationships
- waste/refuse
- emotions
- knowledge or it's opposite
- bad manners or it's opposite
- planned obsolescence
- perfectionism or it's opposite
- inactivity or it's opposite
- life without meaning
- sex, or it's opposite
- shame binding
- hiding or it's opposite
- messy or it's opposite
- smelly or it's opposite
- insensitive or it's opposite
- decisions based on familiarity over options
- innovation for the sake of innovation
- laziness/sloth
- churn
- sleeplessness
- bad hygiene
- 

yet everything above is loved by both those who produce same, but also those who consume same. So 
- why is that?
- what are the threads common to all?
