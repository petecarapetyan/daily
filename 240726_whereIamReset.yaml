240726_whereIamReset.yaml:
  - gotta catch up on timecard/billings 20 hours last week already 30 hours this week 
  - cc today:
      Miriam:
      - get your barf bag out 
      - fat priests always take over as the generations pass 
      - start with a picture, then go backwards to get to what we are doing now 
      - cc25 
      - the more things change, the more they stay the same 
      - basically we are the clean up crew for Trevor's Shiny Train Wrecks:
        - Pete->picture->Miriam->system->nathan->code->app->maintenance->managmentByException 
        - hello barf bag 
    - roll out service approach to LiveCoding 
    - sharpen up repository for next cc25
    - so much stuff still to document
    - run dailies on all systems to see which ones working but just not using?
    - iconography piece is coming into focus need to put into dailies
    - somehow less time-suck into slack
    - finishing up the udu signals security and react models is critical 
    - making a legit home for SSG and WC really is legit 
    - putting up a standard app process is legit especially now time to do it 
    - clarity around buttoning all this stuff up into realize-able picture:
      - seriously Pete
      - it is time to do this 
    - nobody is stopping you, only slack & distractions & lack of dailies/resolve/picture:
      - form the final picture
      - get every detail
      - do like I do and establish every middle step required:
        - dry run each and install into udu 
      - daily process and final picture needs to be a join 
      - miriam>system>nathan>code>app>maintenance>managmentByException 
      - clean up messy situation linking stacks and process and picture and training and tuesday night rollouts
    - giant truck coming straight at us with internship 
    - in a very real sense Trevor has abdicated a ton of this world to me:
      - by being fascinated with shiny objects he leaves all the details to me by default
      - but I also need him to fail else he will not see this at least as a process 
    - all of this is but one step from Training as a product 
    - without Miriam, I am dead in about 80% of what I am doing here 
    - doing a join between inkscape and figma - yeah that is necessary 
    - going back to the canva drawings is pretty necessary 
    - the math on all of the above is and is not working:
      - still too many tasks
      - but the picture part IS working 
      - and the tasks are getting done 
      - and the parts of the process which are failing are getting fixed 
      - and we are developing at least some proficiency 
      - and Trevor isn't totally tanking everything with happy bling world view 
    - how can I challenge Trevor to not bottom fish any more?:
      - is it possible that stupid people are all that is left?
      - is it possible to bring up his previous promise? 
      - what would happen if I just kept answering the question?
    - i guess the august thing - yeah that is broken now, where Trevor exits 
    - i need a firebase instance paid for by Trevor 
    - 
  - this has to happen every day:
    - standard process - same as with cc 
    - picture of result years or months later - same as cc 
    - all of the code same as cc 
    - intolerance for time sucks in the form of daily process first
    - everything points to 25 apps for 25 (17me+8cc)
    - common thread for: 
      - I am not special 
      - I need to be slightly more capable than:
        - the next guy
        - AI 
        - generic robots 
      - everything always keeps migrating back to - literally:
        - DNA 
        - proteins and little sub-cellular machines 
        - wet chemistry 
        - glacial success shifting
      - predatory safeguards are the lesson Trump brought us:
        - you almost have to think about it as a spell
        -
