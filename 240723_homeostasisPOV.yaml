in nature it could be argued that:
  - the whole looks to maintain homeostasis
  - homeostasis is a state of balance
  - one is looking for things that don't grow like cancer
  - one is looking for things that don't shrink like atrophy
  - this is only a POV because sometimes resets are good, also
  - so there is also the idea of homeostasis v change which is valid
  - betterology has to address both
  - things that should not be confused with homeostasis are:
    - contexts with one or more subsets of homeostasis:
      - regression
      - aggression
      - stagnation
      - stasis
      - inertia
      - entropy
      - decay
      - death
      - fear of loss
      - beliefs
      - dogma
      - ideology
      - these are not homeostasis:
        - these are not balance
        - these are not good
        - these are not better
    - what characterizes a faked contextual homeostasis?:
      - some things with proper balanced PID like elbows
      - subsets which are not balanced:
        - slack 
        - tension
        - aggression 
        - fakery/fraud/masking
        - 
  - humans (and other animals) always:
    - over-identify with familiarity:
      - context
      - meaning
      - the present
