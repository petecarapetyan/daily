Story:
  - The greatest gift:
    - Trump gives us the greatest gift we could possibly be given.
    Before:
      - We had everything we needed, except one thing.
      - We lacked a way to appreciate what we had, and prioritize our values
    After:
      - We now have a bottom.
      - We know what self destruction looks like.
      - Every base impulse that wants to lead us astray is now front and center.
    song:
      - Pave Paradise:
        - dont it always seem to go


This one affected me profoundly:
  - https://youtu.be/25LUF8GmbFU?si=cz9BNrdbutt6T-0c
  - the simple power of his story transcends hundreds of contexts
  - reminds me of how every one of these was a young person re-interpretting the story of the age:
    - early american revolutionaries
    - christ and confucius and and and
    - every one of many pioneers

  - the importance is to encourage everyone to start retelling the story
  - and of course, use AI and modern data
  - 

it is curious how easy it is to rebuild the Story:
  - and how reticent we seem to do that, as individuals
  - as if, there was a hidden rule against it 

the process that would be fun to try to rebuild:
  - that aspect of telling the story that had to with individuals 
  - that aspect of telling the story that had to do with validation

the most powerful thing about the above was:
  - i built my life around this story (https://youtu.be/25LUF8GmbFU?si=cz9BNrdbutt6T-0c) 
  - and then it proved not to shake out as valid 
  - don't want to say the word "true" because elbows make every story true  
  - but i can say that it didn't hold up to te context i put it up against 
  - it is extremely time consuming to build stories
  - it takes a lot of data
  - it takes a willingness to collect it and say here it is 
  - it takes a weighting of mixed results 
  - it takes looking at the consequences that are not so obvious 

There are several things that don't seem to work for iterating on a Story: 
  - mixed motives
  - undeclared motives:
    - this would be a longer and less obvious list 
    - this is also where a giant minefield lies 
    - this is also where self doubt is a primary issue 
  - WYSIATI
  - subsetting
  - beliefs 
  - hierarchical sequence squatting
  - anything that resolves to infinity
  - unvalued destruction
  - everything - AKA the maybe story 
  - speed:
    - works for survival related decisions quite a large bit of the time (see elbows)
    - not so brilliant for decisions that look like elbows 
    - not so brilliant as permanent decisions on hold opens or "always"
  - symbolism
  - say one thing, do another 
  - assertion based logic of any flavor
  - strength of feelings - stronger feelings me this over that 
  - TMI don't have time to evaluate 
  - they are just arguing therefor don't have to evaluate data 
  - assumption that bad actors are same screwiness as inarticulate or ill conceived
  - 

things to use as examples of stories that don't work:
  - a million stories that start with "Trust me"
  - senile grandpa shoots grandson
  - abortion as any stories that are too simple 
  - 

stories are: 
  - programs 
  - PIDs 
  - tests 
  - "english"
  - branching and looping decisions (ask chatgpt)
  - elbows 

if there is no good faith or agreement on settled issues, then everything else in the story is invalid:
  - this is what we learned from Donald Trump 
  - there is simply no point 
  - once you go down this road, you cannot go back because it took hundreds of years to settle on the issue 
  - Tom Nichols would be a best ally on this
