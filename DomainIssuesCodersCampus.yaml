How I need to separate domain issues to keep my job:
  - 90/10 domain split - the two Gs:
    - 90% are gym membership - lip service and they belong to sales/revenue
    - 10% are genuine - they are working on new career 
  - we need to calibrate our behavior to:
    - always provide genuine value to gym membership group
    - never assume genuine motives of any student until proves accordingly:
      - even then, look at Ty or Naugler
    - rely on data to tell the story at any given point:
      - the data shows us that you [are, are not] genuinely interested in taking this through to a job:
        - this data:
          - yada
          - yada 
      - here is what we can offer you to help, in case our data is wrong:
        - pause 
        - resources 
        - strategies
        - long term support 
        - 

hah! This is an assignment 2 problem:
  - forget onboarding
  - forget the cheat sheet
  - forget relying on Marcus or Trevor:
    - they are not our friends
    - we cannot rely on anything that they say or do 
  - only rely on the data 
  - be very forthcoming with the data
