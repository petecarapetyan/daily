How to keep going:
  - how to:
    - not lose momentum from going down rabbit holes
    - have plenty of time to waste on rabbit holes
    - not get taken down by 99% of efforts being self destructive?
    - maintain at least the rhythm that is keeping me going?
    - take advantage of other assets as they appear?
    - work on that one part of the story that needs it today?
    - make WYSINATI an asset for the music that evolves?
    - take advantage of the forces that are social media without getting taken down by same?
    - subsume not subset but also not get taken down by what is subsumed?

  - confusion:
    - why is this so hard?

    - some things way too mutable like lies others impossible to move?
    - dark forces so much in play sometimes, others not?

    - why is no-one afraid of automation, robots, 1% and modeling that is known to be terminal?

    - why does no-one see that discernment has all but evaporated?
    - why don't we see that we have all been twitterpated in a bad way?
    - why don't we see that concrete repositories such as DNA and feelings are the undertow being used against us?
    - why don't people freak out that salmon actually change shape and intentionally die, after spawning?
